# Leading Causes of Death in USA



# Description
I have chosen thi

s topic because I have never explored this topic before especially when it comes to data and numbers. It is really shocking and depressing the amount number of people who would die cause of dieseases, you would think with how developed our world is with the modern technology and all, they would be less deaths. While I was researching for data, I thought of how interesting it would be if there is data that would show through out the last 200 years (I'm not sure if there is such data that exist). That would be a very cool Data visualization, especially if it's well designed and interactive.
