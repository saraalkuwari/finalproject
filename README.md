# Leading Causes of Death in USA



# Description
I have chosen this topic because I have never explored this topic before especially when it comes to data and numbers. It is really shocking and depressing the amount number of people who would die cause of dieseases, you would think with how developed our world is with the modern technology and all, they would be less deaths. While I was researching for data, I thought of how interesting it would be if there is data that would show through out the last 200 years (I'm not sure if there is such data that exist). That would be a very cool Data visualization, especially if it's well designed and interactive. 
The first data visualization

Project Procedure: describe your data processing, visualization selection, and analyses post-visualization
I have gotten my data from two websites such as New York Open Data and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Getting the data always should be from reliable source. One of the challenges I faced is that some of the data has too many information that I don't need for my visualization so I had to write the numbers on a piece of paper to just differentiate it from other categories. I have used HighCharts and edit it in JsFiddle, I like how simple and easy to code there, but I didn't like limitation of design, you can change the color but you can't the font family which can be very frustrating for a graphic designer. I have chosen bar chart to best represent what I want to visualize the data with. I really enjoyed whenever you change a certain aspect of the code and view it in the result. My only concern is that when I have embeded the chart to the website it shows the code and the results. I wish there was a way where you can only show the results without the code. 
Things I would like to explore furthur with data visualization, the interactivity. Where the user can interacte with data visualization and make it more engaging and fun.
